# PokerGame
A game where the user plays Texas Hold'em Poker heads up versus a computer opponent. The game follows all the standard rules of Texas Hold'em and ends when one player has all of the other players chips. The decisions that the opponent makes are based on the strength of the cards they hold, however as not to make the opponent predictable and boring/easy to play against, the random module is used in conjunction. This allowed me to vary the opponents level of aggression when it comes to betting strong hands and calling with weaker hands, which gives the opponent a more human like feeling.

This game was created as a solo project as part of my BSc Mathematics from the University of Leeds.
